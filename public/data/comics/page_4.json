From the mysterious Midnight Mission, Moon Knight shelters his people from the weird and horrible - stalking the rooftops and alleys marked with his crescent-moon tag, bringing violence to any who would harm his flock. While Khonshu languishes in prison, Marc Spector's sacred duty must still be observed: the protection of those who travel at night. But what happens when those he would save are turned into weapons against him? Moon Knight must reckon with the sinister plots of Zodiac, wage war with the vampires of the Structure and face a challenge to his status as Fist of Khonshu from a new vigilante on the scene: The Hunter's Moon is rising!
