From the fetid of the swamps of the south comes the Man-Thing! The brilliant Dr. Ted Sallis' progress on a new Super-Solider Serum gained the envious attention of A.I.M. One untested injection and a hot-pursuit car crash into the swamp later, Sallis is forever changed. He is now the Man-Thing, a lumbering creature with the searing power to burn those who know fear! Under writer Steve Gerber, this concept became a 1970s comic-book classic. Mixing horror, occult and the Marvel Universe, Gerber's unique narrative concoctions could produce taut morality tales, biting social commentary, a budding sorceress, the Nexus of All Realities…and Howard the Duck!
